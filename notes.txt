Plan:

- Have a counter which increments and it knows which frame you are on
- If you get a strike on roll 1 of a frame, you go straight to next frame and do not roll again
- If you get a spare or strike you get 1/2 more rolls on the last frame
- Score needs to be some accumulative variable as well.
- If you get a strike your score is 10 + value of next two rolls
- If you get a spare your score is 10 + value of next roll
